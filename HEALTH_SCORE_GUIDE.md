## Score Calculation

The overall health score is calculated as a weighted average:

```
Health Score = (API Usage √ó 0.25) + (Login Frequency √ó 0.20) + 
               (Payment Timeliness √ó 0.20) + (Feature Adoption √ó 0.20) + 
               (Support Tickets √ó 0.15)
```

Each factor is scored individually (0-100) and then combined using the weights above.

## Data Requirements

For accurate health scoring, the system analyzes:

- **API Logs**: Call frequency, success rates, error patterns
- **Login Records**: User authentication logs, session data
- **Billing Data**: Payment history, invoice status, plan changes
- **Feature Usage**: Feature interaction logs, adoption metrics
- **Support History**: Ticket volume, resolution times, satisfaction scores

## Recommendations System

Based on the health score and individual factor performance, the system generates actionable recommendations:

### For Healthy Customers (80-100)
- Explore expansion opportunities
- Introduce advanced features
- Request case studies or testimonials
- Offer referral programs

### For At-Risk Customers (60-79)
