    Calculator that orchestrates all health factors to produce overall health score.

    The calculator includes:
    - Login Frequency (20% weight)
    - Feature Adoption (25% weight)

        Sets up all health factor instances and validates that their weights
        sum to 1.0 for proper normalized scoring. Each factor contributes to
        the overall customer health assessment based on its specific weight.

        Health Factors Initialized:
        - LoginFrequencyFactor: User engagement patterns (weight: 0.20)

        - ApiUsageFactor: API integration depth and usage (weight: 0.30)
